# Heart Disease Detection using Machine Learning

A group project for the course **Data Science for IoT (IT351)** at Qassim University, completed in **December 2024**.  
The goal was to develop a script that applies ML models to detect heart disease based on their health metrics.  
We used existing machine learning libraries to train and compare different models on a public dataset.

## 🧩 My Role

Although it was a team project, I was fully responsible for the **coding and technical part** of the project.

- I used **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook** to implement all parts of the code.
- I added and trained **four different models** using scikit-learn:
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Linear Regression
- I compared their accuracy, visualized the results, and wrote the final version of the code.
- I also explained the implementation to the instructor and the rest of the team, since I had the most experience with Python and Jupyter.

## 📎 Based On

This project is based on an open-source notebook available at:

🔗 [Original Project on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/syedali110/heart-disease-detection/notebook)

We extended the original code by testing multiple models, comparing results, and improving performance.
